### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I study Artificial Intelligence. Check out my latest [published work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=03tssc4AAAAJ):

- GPT-2 Metadata Pretraining Towards Instruction Finetuning for Ukrainian ([UNLP 2023](https://unlp.org.ua)). https://github.com/proger/uk4b
- Re: VAE Approximation Error: ELBO and Exponential Families ([ReScience C](https://zenodo.org/record/8173745), [Tweet](https://twitter.com/darkproger/status/1691755047145673029), [NeurIPS 2023 Journal Track Poster](https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/events/journal_track_2023)). https://github.com/proger/vae

Projects:

- `pip install accelerated-scan`: Accelerated Scan is a high-performance GPU implementation of the first order associative scan for Torch
- `pip install world-model`: Learning from simulation by predicting the next frame and action: https://github.com/proger/world-model
- `pip install haloop`: a [speech recognition](https://wandb.ai/stud76/rnnlm/reports/haloop-on-LibriSpeech--Vmlldzo0MDgzMTQw) and language modelling toolkit for noisy data

I write notes in my blog, https://proger.github.io
