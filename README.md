### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I study Artificial Intelligence. Check out my latest published work:

- GPT-2 Metadata Pretraining Towards Instruction Finetuning for Ukrainian ([UNLP 2023](https://unlp.org.ua)). https://github.com/proger/uk4b

Now I'm building a speech agent: https://wandb.ai/stud76/rnnlm/reports/haloop-on-LibriSpeech--Vmlldzo0MDgzMTQw
